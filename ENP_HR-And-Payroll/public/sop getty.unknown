The field of marketing has long fascinated me because of its dynamism and creativity. In any field, marketing is growing rapidly in the development and functioning of various activities. While in school, I was exposed to the field of marketing. I studied business administration. We picked all kinds of topics with a focus on marketing. These courses were Advertising and Marketing Management and International Marketing. To make our lectures more fruitful, we reviewed and explored some hypothetical solutions and case studies to specific problems. Additionally, these courses have given me a variety of opportunities to learn the basic concepts and applications of marketing.
